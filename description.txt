This Pomodoro timer is a productivity tool built with Python and Tkinter. 
It follows the classic Pomodoro technique, helping users maintain focus by working in intervals with short breaks in between. 
The timer automatically transitions between work sessions and breaks, with a visual and auditory countdown. 
The UI features a dynamic display that changes color based on the current session (work or break), and a reset function to start fresh at any time. 
This project is perfect for anyone looking to enhance their time management skills.
